# BRAIN2SPEECH
by Bálint Pál Gyires-Tóth - Thursday, 14 September 2023, 9:53 PM

The purpose of a brain-computer interface (BCI) is to provide a natural or near-natural channel of communication for people who cannot speak due to physical or neurological impairment. Speech is the primary and most essential means of human communication. However, many people have lost this ability through illness or ill health. The real-time synthesis of speech directly from measured neural activity (BRAIN2SPEECH) would enable natural speech and significantly improve quality of life, especially for severely communication-impaired individuals. Within the project, students study the BRAIN2SPEECH domain and then develop and train new types of neural network architectures. The suggested data is the 'Dataset of Speech Production in intracranial Electroencephalography' (SingleWordProductionDutch), available at https://osf.io/nrgx6/. The related github repository contains a linear regression model which should be replaced by deep neural networks. Basic task: train/valid/test set from single speaker. Advanced task: cross-speaker train and synthesis.
